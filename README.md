# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, training various models, and evaluating their performance.

## Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values.
- Categorizing and encoding features like Name, Sex, Cabin, and Embarked.
- Feature scaling and selection.

## Models Used

The following machine learning models were employed:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Neural Network (NN)

Each model was tuned and evaluated for its accuracy in predicting survival.

## Neural Network Approach (Conv1D)

- **Input Data**: The input data was structured in a 3-dimensional format suitable for Conv1D operations.
- **Conv1D Layer**: This layer performed convolution operations on the input data, extracting relevant features for survival prediction.
- **Output**: The output from the Conv1D layer was then used for further processing and final prediction.


## Results

The performance of each model was evaluated based on accuracy. The Logistic model showed promising results.
